```
pip install openai
```

2. Obtain an API key from OpenAI by creating an account at [https://beta.openai.com/signup/](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

3. Replace the `openai.api_key` value in the code with your API key.

4. Modify the `filename` variable in the code to provide the correct path to your reviews text file.

## Usage
